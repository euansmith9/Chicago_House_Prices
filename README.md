# Chicago_House_Prices

This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices in Chicago
using a dataset of 157 houses. The dataset includes variables such as price, number of bedrooms,
total rooms, house size (space), lot width, annual tax, number of bathrooms, number of garages,
and house condition.
